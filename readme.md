I thought that the available apps to track intermittent fasting are a little bloated so I decided to build my own in a way that others may use it as well without having its data collected and sended to a central server.

For the initial version the app will have the most basic features: track fasts and select the protocol. That's it!

### Run it in development environment

```shell
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

A deployed version will be available soon in my personal domain at first.
